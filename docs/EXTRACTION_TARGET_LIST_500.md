   - Note Google Place IDs (from URL: `place/ChIJ...`)
   - Check for duplicates against existing database

2. **Afternoon (3 hours):** Extract restaurants via admin page
   - Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/add`
   - Enter restaurant name + Google Place ID
   - Click "Start Extraction"
   - Monitor progress (~4 minutes per restaurant)
   - **Extract 15-20 restaurants** (can run concurrently in multiple browser tabs)

3. **Evening (1 hour):** Validate quality
   - Run: `node bin/validate-extraction-quality.js --last-n=50`
   - Check for errors
   - Review photo counts, cuisine mapping
   - Fix any critical issues before next day

### **Daily Checklist:**

- [ ] Extract 50 restaurants (target for 500 in 10 days)
- [ ] Validate quality after extraction: `node bin/validate-extraction-quality.js --last-n=50`
- [ ] Check progress: `node bin/extraction-progress.js`
- [ ] Note any failed extractions for retry

## âš ï¸ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: Not Finding 83 Restaurants in an Area**

**Solution:** Broaden search terms
```
Restaurants in [Area], Goa  (generic search)
Food in [Area], Goa
Dining in [Area], Goa
Best places to eat in [Area], Goa
```

---

### **Issue 2: Too Many Duplicate Chains**

**Examples:** Starbucks, McDonald's, KFC (multiple locations)

**Decision:**
- âœ… **Include:** If different neighborhoods (Starbucks Salmiya vs Starbucks City)
- âŒ **Skip:** If same exact location listed twice

---

### **Issue 3: Low-Quality Restaurants (Below 4.0 Rating)**

**Solution:** Only extract if:
- Unique cuisine not well-represented
- Historic/cultural significance
- Area has <50 total restaurants

**Otherwise:** Skip and find higher-rated alternatives

---

### **Issue 4: Restaurant Closed or Not Found**

**Solution:**
- Mark as failed in extraction status
- Move to next restaurant
- Don't waste time debugging individual failed extractions
- Batch-fix failed ones later

---

## ðŸ’° Cost Estimation

### **Per Restaurant Cost Breakdown:**

| Service | Cost per Restaurant |

| Firecrawl (scraping) | $0.05 |
| OpenAI GPT-4o (AI enhancement) | $0.05 |
| OpenAI Vision API (images) | $0.03 |
